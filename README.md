# Task Manager App

A simple task management application written in C#. This project demonstrates the use of key software design patterns—**Factory**, **State**, and **Facade**—to build a flexible, extensible task tracking system. Users can add tasks, change their state, and manage them easily through a unified interface.

## Features Planned

* Create different types of tasks - factory
* Change task states - state
* Simplified task operations  - facade
* Save and load tasks from file (future)
* Task filtering and sorting (future)
* Make into exe (future)
* GUI interface
